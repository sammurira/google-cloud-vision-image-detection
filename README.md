"If someone wants to contribute and make this dataset bigger and more relevant, any help will be appreciated.

Data is directly taken and labeled from TV show episodes.

Feel free to check and recommend my Medium post Part 1 on a classification model and Part 2 on a detection model (Faster R-CNN) about this dataset and what I am doing with it. You can also find the related GitHub repo here ."
